at
the
end
of
the
world
theres
a
mainframe
a
construct
a
definite
death
a
place
that
powers
this
hideous
development
i
will
destroy
this
entity
in
the
name
of
humanity
cause
i
have
been
corrupted
all
my
will
is
gone
deprived
of
everything
ill
reign
destruction
that
will
never
be
forgotten
and
remove
the
nightmare
from
this
sleep
their
wishes
are
unrealistic
ive
heard
the
prayers
of
a
thousand
different
prophets
no
one
will
ever
be
a
savior
no
one
is
stopping
the
inevitable
a
mass
exodus
will
commence
driving
out
the
possibility
of
opposition
build
my
armies
vast
and
strong
in
the
name
of
the
interloper
ive
placed
myself
inside
your
minds
ive
placed
myself
between
the
thought
and
the
action
the
process
of
conversion
has
begun
transforming
the
minded
to
the
thoughtless
implanting
the
will
to
conquer
silence
all
who
unify
in
defiance
we
are
all
who
refrain
from
extinction
we
are
all
who
refill
the
void
we
will
bring
an
end
to
a
pointless
conversion
a
conversion
that
will
be
the
end
of
the
world
bury
your
will
with
all
other
pandemonium
i
wont
release
my
grasp
man
has
lost
he
has
betrayed
his
intelligence
and
for
that
i
will
demonstrate
my
tolerance
our
hands
are
dealt
and
our
words
wont
suffice
we
are
fallen
and
hell
is
our
price
what
we
assemble
shall
assemble
us
on
our
knees
we
plead
in
human
dust
divide
conquer
power
i
will
not
fall
bow
down
to
me
