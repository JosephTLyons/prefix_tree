# TODO
- Implement Display trait ?
- Clean up code heavily
- Run format
- Remove print debug statements
- Have code reviewed and clean up all the non-idiomatic things in here
- Divide code into modules
- Include free-to-use txt files
- Simply incrementing word count wont work, it assumes all word inserts are unique.  Inserting “dog” and “dog” would count as 2 words.
